# FreeCodeCamp Markdown-Preview Project

This is my answer for the project in the Front-End-Library course project in FCC

## Experience

Making things work with markedjs was a whole lot of pain and frustrations since I never worked with this library and this is the first library I worked with no video tutorials making me lost on how to parse the markdown string

## Learning

I learned a whole lot even though I thought that the project was a bit boring since all I did was making sure the library worked as intended. I learned that reading the documentation of the library worked better than just googling and reading stackoverflow.

## Things that did not went into the final build

Initially I wanted to make prismjs work so that the preview will have some syntax highlighting but prismjs don't work with dynamic content like this project which was a bummer since I thought that it would make the preview look cool for things that have the code tag.
